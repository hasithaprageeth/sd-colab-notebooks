# sd-colab-notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains Colab notebooks and associated files for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models on a culturally-enriched Sri Lankan dataset, specifically designed for Text-to-Image generation tasks.

## Notebooks

### 1. Stable Diffusion LoRA Fine Tuner.ipynb
- This notebook is used to fine-tune the **Stable Diffusion v1.5** model on a culturally-enriched Sri Lankan dataset for Text-to-Image generation.
  
### 2. Stable Diffusion XL LoRA Fine Tuner.ipynb
- This notebook is used to fine-tune the **Stable Diffusion XL** model on the same culturally-enriched Sri Lankan dataset for Text-to-Image generation.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found in the `LoRA_dataset` folder, which contains both the images and the corresponding text prompts for each image. This dataset is designed to enhance the cultural richness of generated images based on text inputs.
